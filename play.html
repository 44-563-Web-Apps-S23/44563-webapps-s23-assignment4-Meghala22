<h4> [REVENUE,</h4> <p> _a Northerner in city attire, without hat, clothes dusty,
is pushed through doorway_. LUKE, _a lanky, ill-dressed Southerner,
following, closes door_. REVENUE'S _hands are tied behind him_.</p>

<h4>LUKE.</h4><p> You must excuse the boys for makin' a demonstration over you,
Mister Revenue, but you see they don't come across you fellers very
frequent, and they allus gits excited.</p>

<h4>REVENUE.</h4> <p>I appreciate that I'm welcome.</p>

<h4>LUKE.</h4><p> 'Deed you is, and I'm just agoin' to untie your hands long nuff
 fer you to take a sociable drink. [_Goes to stranger, feels in
 all-pockets for weapons._] Reckon yer travellin' peaceable. [_Unties
 hands._] Won't yer sit down?</p>

<h4>REVENUE.</h4><p> [_Drawing over chair and sitting._] Thank you. [_Rubs wrists to
 get back circulation._]</p>

<h4>LUKE.</h4><p> [_Going over to cupboard and taking out jug._] Yessa, Mister, the
